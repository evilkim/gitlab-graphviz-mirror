DIRECTORY HIERARCHY:

This directory hierarchy has the source of Sfio, the Safe/Fast I/O library.

. :		source code for Sfio.
./features:	source code for generating configuration parameters.
./Sfio_f:	function versions of sfio macros.
./Stdio_s:	the source level <stdio> compatibility package.
./Stdio_b:	the binary level <stdio> compatibility package.
./Sfio_dc:	a collection of functions to create useful disciplines.
./Sfio_t:	a set of regression tests for the Sfio library.
./Stdio_t:	a set of regression tests for certain Stdio behaviors and
		for the compatibility packages.

SOFTWARE CONSTRUCTION:

Two sets of libraries will be built:
	libsfio.a and libstdio.a: for uni-threaded applications, and
	libsfio-mt.a and libstdio-mt.a: for multi-threaded applications.

Depending on the local platform, an application using the multi-threaded
libraries may need to specify a thread library for linkage. For example,
below are the known requirements for a few popular platforms:

	Irix, Linux, Solaris systems:	-lpthread
	Hpux:				-lcma
	BSD:				none
